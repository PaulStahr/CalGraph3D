Welcome to CalGraph3D!

This program is a program which contains two tools

* A tool for displaying three-dimensional mathematical functions
* A tool for doing ray-tracing with basic geometric surfaces like spheres, paraboloids or flat surfaces or gradient-optics

Both tools build up on [JSymMath](https://github.com/PaulStahr/JSymMath) to evaluate mathematical commands. You can find any documentation there regarding the mathematical expressions.

To make use of volumentric ray-tracing you will need to download and build the native [VolumeRaytracer](https://github.com/PaulStahr/VolumeRaytracer).
